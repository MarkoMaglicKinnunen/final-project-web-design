      <p>Birmingham was founded in 1871 by the Elyton Land Company. The first settlers of Birmingham were
Veterans of Andrew Jackson’s Army after they defeated the Creek Indians inhabiting the area.
But in combination with the fact that there was not enough transportation to connect it to other
settlements and that there was not enough fertile soil to grow mass amounts cotton, the
settlement’s population grew slowly at first but then boomed after the Civil war due to the
improvement of railroads and the discovery of vast amounts of minerals in the area. Because of
this, Birmingham was beginning to aquire its nickname ‘The Magic City’.</p></div>

          On September 15, 1963 a bomb exploded in the back stairway of the Sixteenth Street Baptist
          Church killing four innocent African American Girls named Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson, and Carol Denise McNair. The bombing also injured twenty other people.
          The perpetrators were Robert E. Chambliss, Bobby Frank Cherry, Herman Frank Cash, and Thomas E. Blanton, Jr. This act of terrorism left a scar on the history of Birmingham AL and was one of the many events that motivated the Civil Rights Movement to keep fighting for equality.
